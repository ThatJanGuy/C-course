In this course, part of the C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate program, you will be introduced to the concept of modular programming: that is, dividing up more complex tasks into manageable pieces.

Within moments you will be coding hands-on in a new browser tool developed for this course, receiving instant feedback on your code. No need to install anything!

You will learn how to write your own functions (just like functions in mathematics for example). You will also gain insight into a computer's architecture and learn how its memory is organized.

Given the vast amount of memory computers have these days, how does your program remember where a certain variable is stored? This brings about the important topic of how memory is efficiently addressed inside a computer, and with it, the topic of pointers.

Pointers are often considered the most difficult part and main struggle for C program developers. We will introduce you to this central topic with our novel and innovative visualization tools and show you precisely how pointers work. No need to struggle!

The programming concepts you will gain in this course are foundational to any programming language.

By the end of this short course, you willhave reached the third milestonein the C Programming with Linux Professional Certificate program, unlocking the door to a career in computer engineering.

This course has received financial support from the Patrick & Lina Drahi Foundation.
