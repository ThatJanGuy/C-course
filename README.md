# What is this repo?

I am brushing up my C by taking a series of courses on edx.org. The ones here are offered by Dartmouth and IMT. Together they shal culminate in a C Programming certificate, but that costs a lot of money. So, I decided to document my progress with the given tasks here instead.

The first course was about the absolute basics. Basically "Hello World!" plus a little. I worked with their online Codecasting and examination tool. During the second course I thought it might be interesting to switch to VSCode and train using git and GH while following the course. And that's where we are now.

If you are a prospective employer: **Please be amazed!**

If you are not: Hi there! No idea what brought you here, but I hope you are enjoying yourself. :)

# Note

Should you take the course yourself or know it by heart, You'll see that my solutions differ a bit from the course's solutions. Don't you worry, All my solutions reached 100% in the course. I'm simply not completely new to C/C++ but use this course to fill gaps in my knowledge and build on that. But I do take the liberty to initialze my i's in the for-loops instead of the main function. I remember it took me a while to get used to the habit of initialising in the smallest usable scope and I would like to not jeodardise that.
